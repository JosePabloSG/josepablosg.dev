As the founder of Shrinkily, I developed a URL shortening startup that provides an innovative link management solution. The project explores modern web development technologies, implementing advanced features like efficient URL redirection, intelligent caching, internationalization, and OAuth authentication.
By utilizing SQLite with Turso DB and Prisma ORM, my platform demonstrates a scalable approach to database management and creates a responsive, intuitive system for URL shortening, tracking, and management.
