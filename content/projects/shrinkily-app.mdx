Traditional URL shorteners lack flexibility and customization, offering only generic link shortening without advanced features like custom redirects, link protection, or performance tracking. This limits the needs of content creators and businesses seeking more control.

I developed Shrinkily app, a link management platform that shortens URLs, creates custom redirects, protects links, and tracks performance with data like clicks and interactions. Users can also create personalized pages for each link, with OAuth authentication for added security. The app uses Next.js, React, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, Auth0, and JSON Web Tokens for efficiency and security.

Shrinkily app gives users full control over their links, enhancing marketing and content strategies. Real-time tracking and customization boost engagement and efficiency.

This project helped me understand scalability, security, and performance analysis. I gained experience with advanced features like custom redirects and authentication, using React Query and Auth0, which Iâ€™ve applied to future projects.
