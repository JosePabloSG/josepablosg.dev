As my graduation project for the National University of Costa Rica, I developed a comprehensive Human Resources management system for the Municipality of Nandayure. This full-stack solution streamlines various HR processes, including request management, department organization, job position administration, payroll processing, and digital file storage. The system modernizes the municipality's HR operations by making administrative processes more efficient and accessible, while providing a robust and user-friendly interface tailored to municipal HR management needs. The project showcases patterns with an N-tier architecture, HTTP clients, NextAuth authentication, middlewares, and global state management.
