The Municipality of Nandayure faced inefficiencies and errors due to unorganized information management, relying on paper records for salary certificates, vacation leave, payroll slips, and departmental management.

To solve this, We developed a web-based system that allows users to submit requests for salary certificates, vacations, and payroll slips. The system also includes employee clock-ins/outs, departmental operations, annual budgets, and budget codes. Each user has a dedicated profile for secure, personalized access. The platform was built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Auth0, JSON Web Tokens, TypeScript, and an N-tier architecture to ensure scalability and security.

The system reduced administrative errors, saved time in HR processes, and improved access to information for both employees and administrators. It streamlined HR operations, enhancing overall efficiency.

This project strengthened my understanding of project architecture, team management, and code testing best practices. I also gained hands-on experience with Next.js, React Query, and Auth0, which Iâ€™ve applied to future projects.
