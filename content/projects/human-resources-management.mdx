Traditional municipal management relied on paper-based processes, leading to inefficiencies in handling salary certificates, vacation tracking, payroll management, and departmental operations. This manual approach resulted in frequent errors and delays.

The solution provides a centralized platform with features like digital salary certificate requests, vacation management, automated payroll processing, and employee time tracking. Each user accesses a secure, role-based dashboard that streamlines their specific HR-related tasks.

The platform modernized municipal operations by implementing a digital-first approach to HR management. This transformation improved data accuracy, reduced processing times, and enhanced information accessibility for both staff and administrators.

This project enhanced my capabilities in full-stack development, system architecture, and team collaboration. Key achievements include designing a scalable N-tier architecture and implementing secure user authentication while meeting municipal compliance requirements.
