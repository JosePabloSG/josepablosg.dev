Hi! My name is Jos√© Pablo, I am 21 years old and a software development student from Costa Rica. I have been studying software development for the past three years, focusing on building efficient and innovative digital solutions. My journey has equipped me with the skills needed to create dynamic and user-friendly websites, and I stay updated with the latest technological trends in this ever-evolving field. Creating engaging online experiences is at the core of what I do.

My passion for technology began early and has grown as I pursued formal studies in software development. Over the years, I have built a solid foundation in key languages and frameworks. Recently, I have been expanding my skills in modern web technologies and exploring advanced design concepts.

Currently, I am focusing on refining my skills in languages like C# and TypeScript, and I am working on my personal website using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I am inspired by industry leaders and always look for ways to improve my work.
