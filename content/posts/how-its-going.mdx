Hey there! I'm Jos√© Pablo, a 21-year-old software developer from Costa Rica passionate about web development. Over the past three years, I've been immersing myself in the world of software development, turning my passion for technology into purposeful digital solutions.

My development journey has been driven by the desire to create experiences that matter. What started as curiosity has evolved into a dedicated pursuit of crafting efficient, user-centric applications. Each project has been an opportunity to push boundaries and explore new possibilities in web development.

Currently, I'm diving deep into modern frontend development, working with cutting-edge technologies like Astro and Next.js, while focusing on creating responsive and accessible interfaces with Tailwind CSS. Taking inspiration from the developer community, I've learned to value clean code and user-centric design principles.

While frontend development captures much of my attention, I maintain a strong foundation in backend technologies. I'm actively expanding my expertise with .NET Core and NestJS, believing that understanding both sides of the stack is crucial for building comprehensive solutions.

My next step is focusing on UX/UI design, aiming to blend technical expertise with design thinking. I believe that understanding user behavior and creating intuitive interfaces is crucial for developing truly impactful applications. This journey into design will complement my development skills, enabling me to create more flexible and user-centered solutions.

I'm always excited to collaborate and learn from the community. You can explore my projects and contributions on my GitHub <a href='https://github.com/JosePabloSG' target='_blank'>here</a>, where I regularly share my work and experiments in web development.
