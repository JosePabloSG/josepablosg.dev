Hey there! I'm José Pablo, a 21-year-old software developer from Costa Rica passionate about technology and continuous learning. Over the past few years, I’ve explored the world of web development in depth, transforming my curiosity into a true vocation for creating digital solutions that make an impact.

Throughout my journey, I’ve discovered that programming is much more than just writing code — it’s a way to connect ideas, automate processes, and enhance people’s experiences through technology. This mindset has led me to experiment with a wide range of tools, from frontend development with modern frameworks like Next.js and Astro, to building solid backends with .NET Core and NestJS.

In recent months, I’ve expanded my perspective into new areas that fuel my curiosity even more: automation with n8n, the world of cloud computing, and the endless possibilities of machine learning. Every new technology I discover strengthens my passion for this field and inspires me to keep building smarter, more scalable, and human-centered solutions.

My current focus is on combining these disciplines to create more efficient and connected systems, always guided by a mindset of continuous improvement and collaborative learning. I firmly believe that the best way to grow as a developer is by sharing knowledge and building alongside others.
